# Heart-Prediction-using-ML
Developed The Heart Prediction Using ML (logistic Regression Model and Predictive System).


Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. The healthcare industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.


Created ML model to predict whether the person has heart disease or not by using sci-Kit, NumPy and pandas Libraries and also created the Logistic regression model and the Predicted Model to predict accuracy of Healthy and Defective Heart data. And The accuracy of the data came out to be 83%.






The Parameters Data Required for the Analysis: -

Age.
Sex: 1 = Male, 0 = Female.
(cp) chest pain type (4 values – Ordinal), 1st value: typical angina, 2nd value: atypical angina, 3rd value: non-anginal pain, 4th value: asymptomatic.
(trestbps) resting blood pressure.
(chol) serum cholesterol.
(Fbs) – fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl. 
(restecg) – resting electrocardiography results.
(thalach) – maximum heart rate achieved. 
(exang) – exercise-induced angina.
(oldpeak) – ST depression caused by exercise relative to rest.
(slope) – the slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
(ca) – the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
(thal) – maximum heart rate achieved (Ordinal), 3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect.
