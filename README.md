# Heart-Prediction-using-ML
Developed The Heart Prediction Using ML (logistic Regression Model and Predictive System).


Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. The healthcare industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.


Created ML model to predict whether the person has heart disease or not by using sci-Kit, NumPy and pandas Libraries and also created the Logistic regression model and the Predicted Model to predict accuracy of Healthy and Defective Heart data. And The accuracy of the data came out to be 83%.
